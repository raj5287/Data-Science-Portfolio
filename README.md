# Data-Science-Portfolio
Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects, I have worked for learning and academic purposes.
I have been working on different datasets like Amazon Fine Food Reviews, Personalised
Cancer diagnosis, What's happening in LA (real time dataset).

## Contents
* Machine Learning
  * [Personalised Cancer Diagnosis](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/PersonalizedCancer_tfidf.ipynb) : Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts a given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature using various statistical analysis tools.
  * [Quora Question Pair Similarity Problem](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Quora.ipynb)  : A dataset where prediction has to be made whether two questions are similar or not.

  * [SGD Implemention](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/SGD%20Implementation.ipynb) : Implemented own stochastic gradient descent and gradient descent and compared it with scikit-learn implementation on Boston Housing Price Dataset.
  * [Decision Tree on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20-%20Decision%20Tree.ipynb) : Explored decision tree model on Amazon Fine Food Reviews using various vectorising techniques.
  * [Random Forest vs GBDT(XGBoost) vs GBDT(LightGbm)](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20-%20Random%20Forest.ipynb) : A comparison between random forest implemented using scikit learn and gradient boosted decision tree implemented using XGBoost and LightGBM on Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset.
  * [Kmeans Clustering vs Agglomerative Clustering vs DBScan Clustering](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20Reviews%20-%20Clustering.ipynb) : A brief comparison between Kmeans clustering, Agglomerative Clustering and DBScan clutering and how they work.
  * [Truncated SVD With KMeans Clustering](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20Reviews%20-%20Truncated%20SVD.ipynb) : Created Co-occurence matrix (not co-variance matrix) and performed truncated singular value decomposition and used kmeans clustering to form the clusters of words.
  * [Linear SVM vs RBF SVM on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20-%20Support%20Vector%20Machines.ipynb) : A brief comparison between Linear Kernal and RBF kernal of SVM on Amazon Fine Food Reviews, how well they perform using AUC score as a performance metric.
* Data Analysis And Visualization
  * [TSNE on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/TSNE.ipynb) : Perfomed TSNE on Amazon Fine food Reviews to reduce the Word Vector Dimensions And See if Positive and Negative reviews can be separated or not.
  * [Dashboard Of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions): Dashboard of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions. This Dataset is updated almost daily. This dashboard is configured to run daily at 0000hrs UTC enabling the visuals to be upto date.
  * [EDA on Haberman's Survival Dataset](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/haberman's%20dataset%20case%20study.ipynb) : Exploratory data analysis done on Haberman's Cancer Survival study Dataset
* Deep Learning (Keras)
  * [Amazon Fine food Reviews with LSTM](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon_Fine_Food_Reviews_using_LSTM.ipynb) : A dataset cotaining 500k datapoints of reviews of food by users on Amazon. Used LSTM to predict the polarity of the reviews
  * [Music Generation Using Char RNN](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/music-generation-using-char-rnn) : Generating a good quality music after training on around 1850 data points. The files has been downloaded from [here](http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/music/book/oneills/1850/X/) and compiled into one dataset. The dataset contains music in abc format and music is generated using Character Rnn.
* Deep Learning (Pytorch)
  * [Predction of Fashion type of Image](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Fashion_MNIST_(Exercises).ipynb) : A simple model predicting the type of fashion of an image. The dataset is the exmaple Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is created in pytorch using two methods : first directly creating the model and the second with creaing a class inheriting the nn.Module class.
