# Machine-Learning-Porfolio
Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects, I have worked for learning and academic purposes.
I have been working on different datasets like Amazon Fine Food Reviews, Personalised
Cancer diagnosis, What's happening in LA (real time dataset).

## Contents
* Machine Learning
  * [Personalised Cancer Diagnosis](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/PersonalizedCancerDiagnosis.ipynb) : Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts a given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature using various statistical analysis tools.
* Natural Language Processing
  * [KNN on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/Knn%20on%20Amazon%20food%20using%204%20methods.ipynb) : Used KNN algorithm to predict the polarity of the reviews. Used various techniques to vectorize the text and improve the accuracy.
* Data Analysis And Visualization
  * [TSNE on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/TSNE.ipynb) : Perfomed TSNE on Amazon Fine food Reviews to reduce the Word Vector Dimensions And See if Positive and Negative reviews can be separated or not.
  * [Dashboard Of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions): Dashboard of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions. This Dataset is updated almost daily. This dashboard is configured to run daily at 0000hrs UTC enabling the visuals to be upto date.
  * [EDA on Haberman's Survival Dataset](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/haberman's%20dataset%20case%20study.ipynb) : Exploratory data analysis done on Haberman's Cancer Survival study Dataset
* Deep Learning
 * [Amazon Fine food Reviews with LSTM]() : A dataset cotaining 500k datapoints of reviews of food by users on Amazon. Used LSTM to predict the polarity of the reviews
