# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects, I have worked for learning and academic purposes.
I have been working on different datasets like Amazon Fine Food Reviews, Personalised
Cancer diagnosis, What's happening in LA (real time dataset).

  * [TSNE on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/TSNE.ipynb) : Perfomed TSNE on Amazon Fine food Reviews to reduce the Word Vector Dimensions And See if Positive and Negative reviews can be separated or not.
  * [Dashboard Of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions): Dashboard of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions. This Dataset is updated almost daily. This dashboard is configured to run daily at 0000hrs UTC enabling the visuals to be upto date.
  * [EDA on Haberman's Survival Dataset](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/haberman's%20dataset%20case%20study.ipynb) : Exploratory data analysis done on Haberman's Cancer Survival study Dataset
* Deep Learning
  * [Amazon Fine food Reviews with LSTM](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon_Fine_Food_Reviews_using_LSTM.ipynb) : A dataset cotaining 500k datapoints of reviews of food by users on Amazon. Used LSTM to predict the polarity of the reviews
  * [Music Generation Using Char RNN](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/music-generation-using-char-rnn) : Generating a good quality music after training on around 1850 data points. The files has been downloaded from [here](http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/music/book/oneills/1850/X/) and compiled into one to make the dataset. The dataset contains music in abc format and music is generated using Character Rnn.
