# Machine-Learning-Porfolio
Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects, I have worked for learning and academic purposes.
I have been working on different datasets like Amazon Fine Food Reviews, Personalised
Cancer diagnosis, What's happening in LA (real time dataset).

## Contents
* Machine Learning
  * [Personalised Cancer Diagnosis](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/PersonalizedCancerDiagnosis.ipynb) : Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts a given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature using various statistical analysis tools.
* Natural Language Processing
  * [KNN on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/Knn%20on%20Amazon%20food%20using%204%20methods.ipynb) : Used KNN algorithm to predict the polarity of the reviews. Used various techniques to vectorize the text and improve the accuracy.
  * [Logistic Regression on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression%20K%20fold.ipynb) : Build a model using logistic regression on Amazon Fine Food Reviews using variuos vectorizing techniques.
  * [SGD Implemention](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/SGD%20Implementation.ipynb) : Implemented own stochastic gradient descent and gradient descent and compared it with scikit-learn implementation.
  * [Decision Tree on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20-%20Decision%20Tree.ipynb) : Explored decision tree model on Amazon Fine Food Reviews using various vectorising techniques.
  * [Comparison of Random Forest vs XGBoost(GBDT) vs LightGbm(GBDT)](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Amazon%20Fine%20Food%20-%20Random%20Forest.ipynb) : A comparison between random forest implemented using scikit learn and gradient boosted decision tree implemented using XGBoost and LightGBM on Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset.
* Data Analysis And Visualization
  * [TSNE on Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/TSNE.ipynb) : Perfomed TSNE on Amazon Fine food Reviews to reduce the Word Vector Dimensions And See if Positive and Negative reviews can be separated or not.
  * [Dashboard Of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions): Dashboard of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions. This Dataset is updated almost daily. This dashboard is configured to run daily at 0000hrs UTC enabling the visuals to be upto date.
  * [EDA on Haberman's Survival Dataset](https://github.com/raj5287/Machine-Learning-Porfolio/blob/master/haberman's%20dataset%20case%20study.ipynb) : Exploratory data analysis done on Haberman's Cancer Survival study Dataset
* Deep Learning
  * [Amazon Fine food Reviews with LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/amazon-fine-food-reviews-using-lstm) : A dataset cotaining 500k datapoints of reviews of food by users on Amazon. Used LSTM to predict the polarity of the reviews
  * [Music Generation Using Char RNN](https://www.kaggle.com/raj5287/music-generation-using-char-rnn) : Generating a good quality music after training on around 1850 data points. The files has been downloaded from http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/music/book/oneills/1850/X/ here and compiled into one to make the dataset. The dataset contains music in abc format and music is generated using Character Rnn.
